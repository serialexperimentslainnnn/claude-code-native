# Skill inventory — what Claude can do in the IDE

Every capability Claude has inside the IDE is an MCP tool served by the plugin itself. This is the
inventory: what exists today, how each tool is reached, and what the roadmap still owes. The order of
work lives in [`MCP_ROADMAP.md`](MCP_ROADMAP.md); the architecture in [`../DIRECTIVES.md`](../DIRECTIVES.md).

## How a tool is reached

Four MCP servers run inside the plugin, one per family, over Unix sockets: **`code`**, **`run`**,
**`vcs`** and **`ops`**. Each one exposes only three meta-tools, so nothing loads up front:

| Meta-tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `domains()` | Lists the server's domains, one line each. Always first. |
| `tools(domain)` | Lists the tools of one domain with their parameters. Only for the domain about to be used. |
| `run(tool, args)` | Runs one tool. Every result is TOON. The Security Guard judges `args` before anything runs. |

A request in the chat reaches a tool through that ladder: *"read `Foo.kt`"* becomes
`mcp__code__domains` → `mcp__code__tools(read)` → `mcp__code__run(read_file, {path})`. The examples below
write only the last step, as `server ▸ tool {args}`.

Rules that hold for every tool:

- **Lists**: any tool with a `paths`, `queries`, `names`, `positions`, `edits`, `files`, `hashes` or
  `statements` parameter runs once per item in a single call and draws one card per item. Up to 50 items.
  `git_stage` and `git_commit` take `paths` as one call, not a batch.
- **Long tools** (`build`, `run_configuration`, `run_tests`, `shell`, `http_run`) stream their output to the
  card, answer `status: running` after `wait` seconds, and are resumed with `job`.
- **Positions** are 1-based `line` and `column`; paths are absolute or relative to the project root.
- Every enumerating tool carries a `max`, and says `truncated` when it hit it.
- A tool marked *mutates* is a change the user sees in the IDE (a diff, a refresh, a dialog).

## `code` — the project as the IDE resolves it

## Not tools, but capabilities that ride on them

- **The Security Guard** judges every `run(tool, args)` inside the server; a refusal comes back as the
  tool's error with the rule and the string that tripped it. The answer is to change that string, not the tool.
- **Cards**: every own call is a card in the chat, one per item in a list, with live lines for long tools, a
  diff and Restore for edits, and a one-click link into the IDE (commit, log, tool window, terminal, run,
  build, problems, diff, action).
- **The rules block**: the `<ide-integration>` fragment rides the system prompt and a hook every turn and
  names which tool replaces which native one; each rule is a switch in Settings ▸ Claude Code.

## Board — phase 1, "Claude on JetBrains"

The order of this phase. **Legend**: ☐ to do · ◐ in progress · ☑ done and committed. A row moves in the
same commit that lands its tools, and the tools enter the tables above in that commit. Every domain holds
at most four tools; a capability that needs more is a new domain. Two laws close the surface: every
registered action is reachable through `actions` + `ide_action(target)`, and every action Claude takes is
mirrored in the IDE without taking the user's focus.

### P0 — foundations and the reported bugs

| Capability | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| An own call made by a subagent gets its card, nested under the agent | `ToolEvents` | ☑ |
| Permission popup, approval rows and guard log name the tool (`code ▸ read_file ▸ path`), not `run` | `OwnTools.display` on every surface | ☑ |
| An agent still reasoning is never shown as completed | `AgentEnding` | ☑ |
| The rules block has no length limit; the test asserts coverage and prints the size | `IdeMcpPrompt`, `IdeRuleText`, `IdeRule`, `IdeMcpPromptTest`, `IdeRuleCoverageContractTest` | ☑ |
| 250 lines per file, imports not counted | `FileSizeContractTest` | ☑ |
| Reveal without focus on every existing tool; `FocusKeeper` returns the focus the platform steals; the terminal is never focused nor its tab switched | `FocusKeeper`, every domain, `FocusContractTest` | ☑ |
| Live mirror with one switch (Settings ▸ Claude Code, ON): reads in the preview tab, edits in a real tab, commits in the log, nodes in Services, problems in their tab, runs in their window | `Reveal`, `IdeMcpState.mirror`, Settings section | ☑ (build, run, tests and debug are shown by the platform itself, focus-free by default) |
| `vcs_open(log, range)` off the deprecated `openLogTab` | `GitLogNavigator` | ☑ |
| `run_tests(path)` prefers the framework producer over Gradle | `TestTools` | ☑ (when the IDE offers one: with Gradle's *Run tests using: Gradle*, the only producer is Gradle's, and a project with several `Test` tasks may land in the wrong one — run the named configuration then) |

### P1 — every action, with its target

| Capability | Tools (domain) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| The action catalogue of the user's IDE, enabled-in-context; the main menu tree | `actions`, `menu` (`actions`) | ☑ |
| Appearance and UI toggles | `appearance`, `ui` (`actions`) | ☑ |
| `ide_action` with a target: file/position, commit, Services node | `ide_action` +`path`/`line`/`column`/`hash`/`node` (`ide`), `TargetContext` | ☑ |
| Code menu editing actions at a position | `editor_action` (`editor`) | ☑ |
| Undo, redo, replace in path, line operations | `undo`, `redo`, `search_replace`, `line_ops` (`edit_ops`) | ☑ |
| Recent files/locations/changes, back/forward, clipboard compare, schemes | `recent`, `navigate_history`, `compare_clipboard`, `scheme` (`recent`) | ☑ (locations stay out: `IdeDocumentHistory.getBackPlaces` is Internal) |
| Editor tabs, layouts, zoom, editor settings | `tabs`, `layout`, `zoom`, `editor_settings` (`window`) | ☑ |
| Every Git-menu dialog by name | `vcs_action` table extended (`forge`) | ☑ |

### P2 — Git as the log and the branches panel do it

| Capability | Tools (domain) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| The commit context menu on a hash; branch operations through `GitBrancher`; worktrees; remotes | `commit_action`, `branch_op`, `worktrees`, `remotes` (`log_ops`) | ☑ |
| Stash, shelve, patches, rollback | `stash`, `shelve`, `patch`, `rollback` (`changes`) | ☑ (patch apply is the IDE's dialog: `ApplyPatchUtil` is Internal) |
| Blame, file history, local history, a file at a ref | `blame`, `file_history`, `local_history`, `file_at` (`history`) | ☑ (revert uses `Label.revert`, marked Obsolete with no replacement) |

### P3 — pull and merge requests as data

| Capability | Tools (domain) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub pull requests listed and opened through the IDE's GitHub plugin | `pull_requests`, `pull_request` (`forge`), `GitHubGateway` | ☑ (data through the IDE's account; `open` selects the request in the IDE's Pull Requests view by selecting its row and firing the view's own action, the browser only when the view does not list it) |
| The release driven from the IDE: create, comment, watch and merge pull requests; verify tags, runs, the Release and the Marketplace | `pr_create`, `pr_comment`, `pr_checks`, `pr_merge` (`pull_request_ops`); `tags`, `workflow_runs`, `release`, `marketplace` (`release`); `MarketplaceGateway` | ☑ (GitHub through the IDE's account; the Marketplace through its public API) |
| GitLab merge requests: actions and view; data if a public path exists | `vcs_action`, `GitLabGateway` | ☑ actions only: `GitLabAccountManager` and `GitLabProjectViewModel` are Internal, so no data path exists; `vcs_action(merge_requests, create_merge_request, clone_gitlab, create_snippet, gitlab_accounts)` covers the submenu |

### P4 — analysis, views, files, refactorings

| Capability | Tools (domain) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Inspect a scope, code cleanup, dependency analysis, data flow | `inspect_scope`, `cleanup`, `file_dependencies`, `dataflow` (`analyze`) | ☑ (backward dependencies is the IDE's window: `BackwardDependenciesBuilder` is Internal) |
| Stack traces, duplicates, nullity, related symbols | `stack_trace`, `duplicates`, `infer_nullity`, `related` (`analysis`) | ☑ (`AnalyzeStacktraceUtil` is Internal: the frames are parsed here and the dialog opens with the text on the clipboard) |
| Diffs, compare, mark directory as, open in | `diff_show`, `compare`, `mark_as`, `open_in` (`views`) | ☑ |
| Copy path, file type, ignore files, delete | `copy_path`, `file_type`, `ignore`, `delete_file` (`files`) | ☑ |
| The Refactor menu beyond rename/move/safe-delete | `introduce`, `extract`, `inline`, `members` (`refactor_ops`) | ☑ |

### P5 — roadmap horizon 2

| Capability | Tools (domain) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Live and file templates (R1) | `templates`, `template_apply`, `file_templates`, `file_from_template` (`templates`) | ☑ |
| Injected languages, quick documentation (R2; `docs` reveals the popup, `DocumentationTarget` is override-only) | `injections`, `inject_at`, `docs` (`language`) | ☑ (`inject_at` goes through IntelliLang's `TemporaryPlacesRegistry` by reflection in that plugin's loader) |
| Bookmarks and the project view (R3; Structure follows the caret) | `bookmarks`, `bookmark_add`, `bookmark_remove`, `project_view` (`bookmarks`) | ☑ |
| The workspace model, read-only (R4) | `workspace` (`workspace`) | ☑ |
| PSI as a tree (R5) | `psi_tree`, `psi_at`, `psi_replace`, `psi_insert` (`psi`) | ☑ |
| The IDE's indexes (R6) | `index_keys`, `index_query`, `stub_query` (`index`) | ☑ |
| UAST (R7) | `uast_tree`, `uast_at` (`uast`) | ☑ (UAST ships inside the Java plugin: optional dependency `claude-java.xml`, the domain is absent on IDEs without Java) |

### P6 — roadmap horizon 3, presence

| Capability | Tools (domain) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Editor markup: highlights, gutter icons, inline hints (S1) | `mark_add`, `mark_remove`, `marks`, `hint_add` (`markup`) | ☑ (document markup model + inlays; ids live with the server) |
| Banners, status bar, scratches (S2, S3) | `banner_show`, `banner_clear`, `status`, `scratch_create` (`presence`) | ☑ (`BannerProvider` editor notification + `BannerRegistry` service) |
| One edit, one undo entry, one history label (S4) | `edit` domain | ☑ (every `replace_text`/`insert_text`/`write_file` is one write command and puts a Local History label named after it) |

### P7 — Services in depth, the closed plugins

| Capability | Tools (domain) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A node's data, extract, expand, events | `service_data`, `service_extract`, `service_expand`, `service_events` (`service_view`) | ☑ (`service_data` reads the editors inside the node's content component; Docker/Kubernetes stay closed, so no deeper data path) |
| Deployment, SSH sessions, Qodana, vulnerable dependencies (S5) | `deployment`, `ssh_session`, `qodana`, `vulnerable_dependencies` (`remote`) | ☑ actions discovered by id fragment on the user's IDE (closed plugins have no source to pin); Qodana results and vulnerable dependencies come from the Problems collector |

### P8 — run, tools, consoles, the client

| Capability | Tools (domain) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Build a module or a file; run with coverage; more step kinds; watches | `build` +`kind` (module, file), `run_configuration` +`executor` (run, debug, coverage, profile), `step` +`force_into`, `smart_into`, `mute` (`run`, `debug`) | ☑ except watches: the watches model (`XDebugSessionData`, the watches manager) is Internal at 262, so `values(expression)` is the evaluation path |
| Edit configurations, attach, profile, coverage | `edit_configuration`, `attach`, `coverage` (`run_ops`); profile = `run_configuration(executor=profile)` | ☑ |
| Terminal tabs | `terminal_tabs` (`terminal`) | ☑ |
| Javadoc, launchers, XML, Markdown | `javadoc`, `launcher`, `xml`, `markdown` (`tools_menu`) | ☑ (dialogs the user finishes; javadoc headless needs the Java plugin's `JavadocGeneratorRunProfile`, which is not public) |
| Groovy console, Kotlin bytecode and configuration, Python console | `groovy_console`, `kotlin_bytecode`, `kotlin_configure`, `python_console` (`consoles`) | ☑ by action, discovered where the Kotlin and Python ids are plugin-defined; the bytecode text stays in the IDE's panel (no public document accessor) |
| Any MCP client drives the IDE (Q10); Remote Development (S6) | `McpClient` (test source) + `McpClientHeadlessTest`, [`MCP_CLIENT.md`](MCP_CLIENT.md); Remote Development = the split plugin: the chat is drawn in JetBrains Client over the platform RPC, the servers run on the host | ☑ |

**Out, on record**: `completion` (its parameters have no public constructor), LSP (commercial IDEs; runtime
detection if ever needed), `sdk_set` (a global change that goes through the dialog), `structure_select`
(no public accessor; the Structure window follows the caret), and the third-party server tools discarded in
the roadmap's coverage matrix — change signature as data, super methods, structural search and replace,
module and project lifecycle, plugin install, IDE restart.
