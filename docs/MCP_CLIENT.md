# Driving the IDE from any MCP client

The four IDE servers — `code`, `run`, `vcs`, `ops` — are ordinary MCP servers that happen to live inside
the plugin. Claude Code is their first client, not their only one: anything that speaks MCP drives the IDE
the same way, with the same tools ([`SKILL_INVENTORY.md`](SKILL_INVENTORY.md)) and under the same
Security Guard. The reference client is `src/test/kotlin/dev/lain/claudejb/mcp/McpClient.kt`, exercised
end to end by `McpClientHeadlessTest`: connect, authenticate, `initialize`, `domains`, `read_file`.

## Where the servers are

One set per open project, started with its first chat, on the machine that holds the project (the host, in
Remote Development). They listen on Unix sockets, never on a port:

```
<IDE temp>/claude-ide-mcp/<random id>/
  code.sock  run.sock  vcs.sock  ops.sock   # one per server that has at least one live domain
  token                                     # the current token, mode 0600; the directory is 0700
```

`<IDE temp>` is `PathManager.getTempPath()`, falling back to `java.io.tmpdir` when the socket path would
be too long. The id is random per project open and the directory dies with the project. To find it:

- the `claude` process the plugin launched received it in `--mcp-config` (`ps` shows the socket path in the
  bridge's arguments);
- `idea.log` prints `IDE MCP servers listening under <dir>` when they start.

A server whose plugins are all missing (for example `vcs` without Git4Idea) has no socket at all.

## Two ways in

### 1. stdio, through the bundled bridge

Every MCP client understands a stdio server. The plugin ships one, dependency-free, that translates
standard JSON-RPC lines on stdin/stdout to the socket's wire and attaches the token itself:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "code": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "<java of the IDE>/bin/java",
      "args": ["-cp", "<plugin dir>/lib/*", "dev.lain.claudejb.mcp.StdioBridge", "<dir>/code.sock"]
    }
  }
}
```

This is exactly what the plugin hands to `claude` (`McpConfigBuilder.ownMcpServer`). The IDE's own Java
runs the bridge because it is the one that is certainly there; the bridge has no dependencies.

### 2. the socket itself

For a client that would rather skip the process:

- **Framing**: each message is its byte length in decimal ASCII, a newline, then the payload
  (`Frames.java`). Both directions. The ceiling is `Frames.MAX_FRAME_BYTES`.
- **Payload**: JSON-RPC 2.0, encoded as [TOON](https://github.com/toon-format/toon) rather than JSON
  (`model/mcp/toon/`). The reply is TOON too; decode it back to JSON.
- **Authentication**: every request and notification carries the token in
  `params._meta["dev.lain.claudejb/token"]` (`StdioBridge.TOKEN_KEY`). Read it from the `token` file beside
  the socket. It rotates every `TokenRing.ROTATION_MILLIS` with a `TokenRing.DEFAULT_OVERLAP_MILLIS` grace
  period, so a long-lived client re-reads the file when a reply says `request rejected` — that message is
  all the server says, whatever was wrong.
- **Methods**: `initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `server/discover`; the notification
  `notifications/cancelled` with `requestId` drops a pending call.
- **Tools**: three meta-tools, `domains()`, `tools(domain)`, `run(tool, args)`; the answer is
  `result.content[0].text`, TOON. Unknown tool or bad arguments come back as `isError: true` with the reason.
- **Concurrency**: one connection carries up to `ServerEndpoint.QUEUE_DEPTH` calls in flight; replies
  come back as each tool finishes, not in request order — correlate by `id`.

## Who may connect

The token is the lock: without it, nothing answers. A connection the plugin did not launch itself is
announced with a notification, and Settings ▸ Claude Code ▸ *Ask me before an unexpected client may talk
to our servers* holds it until the user answers **Allow** (closing the notice rejects it). Whoever the
client is, the Security Guard judges every `run(tool, args)` before anything runs.

## Remote Development

The plugin is a split plugin with three content modules: `dev.lain.claudejb.shared` holds the chat contract
(`ChatApi`), `dev.lain.claudejb.frontend` the tool window, the embedded browser, the page and its theme, and
`dev.lain.claudejb.backend` the sessions, these servers, the guard, the settings, Git and the diffs. In Remote
Development the frontend module loads in JetBrains Client and the backend module on the host, and the page
reaches the backend through the platform's RPC. The chat works there as it does locally. The plugin is
installed on the host and on the client; the client gets its copy from the Marketplace through plugin sync.

The servers, their sockets, their token and the `claude` process are always on the host, beside the project.
A client on the host — a `claude` in an SSH shell, or anything that reads this page — connects as described
above. A client on the client machine cannot reach a Unix socket of another host; that is by design, not an
omission.

There is one code path for a local IDE, Remote Development and the Code With Me host, and no mode detection:
the plugin never asks the platform whether it is split — those APIs are internal
(`RemoteDevApiContractTest`) — and no port is forwarded. In Code With Me only the host has the chat; guests
have none.
