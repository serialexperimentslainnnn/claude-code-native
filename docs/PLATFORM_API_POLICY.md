# Platform API policy

No deprecated API, no internal API, no warnings. The only tolerable warning is an experimental API.

Two things enforce it. The compiler, because warnings are errors and a deprecated use warns while an
experimental one does not, so the rule needs no list. And a contract test, because an internal API produces
no warning at all — the compiler cannot see the difference.

Everything below was read from the platform source at `idea/253.29346.138`. The verification method matters:
fetch the file contents through the forge API and decode them. **A summarising fetch is not acceptable for
code**, because it loses signatures, and an approximate signature is indistinguishable from an invented one.

| The brancher's string merge | deprecated | the reference overload |
| The run manager's two-argument add, and its template flag | deprecated; internal | the single-argument add |

| The plugin manager's descriptor lookups: by class, by id, and the plugin arrays | internal since 262 | the plugin-aware class loader's descriptor and id for the plugin a class came from; an optional content module declaring the other plugin in its `<dependencies>` for that plugin's classes, which only that module's class loader sees; the installed and loaded checks, which stay public |
| The terminal tool window manager's shell widget creator | deprecated since 261 | the terminal tool window tabs manager's tab builder, and the view's send-text builder |
| The breakpoint manager's five-argument add-line-breakpoint | deprecated for removal since 262 | the four-argument form, then the breakpoint's temporary setter |
| The terminal execution console's constructors and its LF-to-CRLF switch | deprecated since 261; the builder they name is 262-only | a console view from the text console builder factory, attached to the process handler |
| The build file position's file getter | deprecated for removal since 262; its path getter is 262-only | the message event's navigatable: a file navigatable's descriptor, or an open-file descriptor |
| The PATH utility's find-in-path family | deprecated for removal since 263; find-first is 263-only | the PATH variable value and its directory list, with the exact executable names |
| Implementing the composite debugger node | its single-argument too-many-children is abstract and deprecated at once, so every implementation overrides a deprecated method | a dynamic proxy of the interface, dispatching by method name |

## Tolerated, because experimental is not a promise broken

The project task execution environment factory; the file editor manager's current-file and can-open checks;
the project-scoped JDK table getter; the module manager's all-module descriptions; the service view
descriptor's unique id; the bookmarks manager; and the terminal tool window tabs manager with its builders.

## What the verifier is told to leave alone

One class-name prefix, `org.jetbrains.uast`, is declared external to the verifier. UAST ships inside the Java
plugin, which this plugin depends on optionally; on an IDE without Java the package does not exist, the
UAST domain is never registered, and the verifier would still count the unresolved package as a
compatibility problem. The compile against the floor and the availability check are what cover that
package instead.

## Watch list

Not annotated today, but worth isolating in a single file so a change lands in one place: the public
highlight processing entry point carries an in-source note about being marked deprecated in future; and
find-in-project, the intentions pass, cached intentions, the inspection engine and the external system
utilities all live in implementation modules even though they are not annotated.

## Corrections worth keeping

- The detected line separator getter is a method of the **virtual file**, not of the text loading utility.
  What the loading utility does have is line-separator detection and conversion, and that conversion takes a
  requestor.
- **A virtual file system requestor is never null.** Null is interpreted as an external change, which
  detaches an edit from the local history that would otherwise group it.
- The local history service **never returns null**; when unavailable it returns an inert stand-in, so
  availability is checked with its enabled flag rather than a null comparison.
- Several stub index overloads **silently discard** the id filter passed to them, and one throws on a scope
  without a project.
- Pattern matching is a predicate for extension points, not a way to find elements, and its own javadoc asks
  that it not be overused.
- Language server integration is not in Community at all, so a domain built on it would not start.
