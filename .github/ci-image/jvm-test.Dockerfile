# jvm-test — the CI image for every job that runs Gradle. Built ON TOP of node-test.
#
# WHO USES IT
# `JVM tests`, `Static analysis`, `Plugin verifier` and `UI end-to-end tests` in ci.yml, `CodeQL
# (java-kotlin)`, the weekly drift check, and the release gate in release.yml.
#
# WHY IT IS BUILT FROM node-test RATHER THAN FROM fedora
# Two reasons, and the second is the one that matters.
#
# 1. No duplication. The base package list and the npm cache warm-up are written once, in
#    node-test.Dockerfile. Two standalone files would have to keep them in step by hand, and the failure
#    mode of that is not a build error — it is two images that quietly disagree about the Node version.
# 2. It needs Node anyway. Three of the jobs above run Gradle AND npm in a single job: `Static analysis`
#    (detekt and spotless, then eslint and prettier), `drift` (`npm install` then `checkDrift`), and the
#    release gate (`npm test` then `test verifyPlugin`). Splitting Node out would mean splitting those jobs
#    in two, and a new job is a whole extra image pull — the exact cost this segmentation exists to remove.
#
# The registry stores the shared layers ONCE, so this is not a second copy of the small image. A job that
# needs neither image runs on a bare runner and is not served from here at all — `Build plugin` is the
# example: it downloads an artifact and runs `unzip`, and used to pull GB to do it.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN HERE: THE VERIFIER'S IDEs
# Baking what `verifyPlugin` downloads once made the single image 38.1 GB, 29.1 GB of it extracted IDEs.
# The verifier is their only consumer and runs ONLY on a pull request from develop into main — a handful of
# times a month. Paying 29 GB on every job's pull, permanently, to save ten minutes on the rarest job is the
# wrong side of that trade by two orders of magnitude. There is a second reason that would have bitten
# silently: the verifier resolves IDEs from the EAP/RC channels, so the set MOVES, and the day JetBrains
# publishes a new build the baked copies stop matching and Gradle downloads the new one anyway.
#
# BUILDING — node-test FIRST, since this image starts from it. From the repository ROOT, so /.dockerignore
# applies:
#
#   V=v1.0.0
#   docker build -f .github/ci-image/node-test.Dockerfile -t ghcr.io/OWNER/node-test:$V .
#   docker build -f .github/ci-image/jvm-test.Dockerfile  -t ghcr.io/OWNER/jvm-test:$V  \
#     --build-arg NODE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/OWNER/node-test:$V .
#   docker push ghcr.io/OWNER/node-test:$V
#   docker push ghcr.io/OWNER/jvm-test:$V
#
# The tag is `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, never `latest`. Bumping it is a commit: change the tag here and in every
# workflow that references it, so the two move together in one reviewable diff. Both images share a version
# because this one is derived from that one — they are not independently versionable.

# Declared before FROM so it can be used there. The default names this repository's own package; a fork
# overrides it with --build-arg rather than editing the file.
ARG NODE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/serialexperimentslainnnn/node-test:v1.1.0
FROM ${NODE_IMAGE}

# NB there is no dnf tuning here and that is not an omission: `max_parallel_downloads=20` and
# `fastestmirror=True` were written into /etc/dnf/dnf.conf by node-test, and this image starts from its
# filesystem — so the JDK transaction below already runs with them. Adding the lines again would append a
# SECOND copy of each key to dnf.conf rather than overriding anything.
#
# There is deliberately no `dnf-plugins-core`: nothing here calls `dnf config-manager` — the repo file is
# written with `printf` — and `curl` is already in the base image, so installing it dragged in a ~150 MB
# Python stack to run a command nobody ran.
#
# `python3` is EXPLICIT, and that is a correctness requirement rather than a convenience: `bin/fake-claude`,
# the deterministic stand-in the integration tests drive a real ClaudeSession against, is a
# `#!/usr/bin/env python3` script. It used to arrive only as a transitive dependency of that unused package
# — a load-bearing dependency held up by an accident.
#
# `zip` is added here rather than in node-test because only the Gradle side packages archives.

# THE DISPLAY STACK, for `UI end-to-end tests` — the one job here that draws.
#
# That job boots a real IDE behind a virtual framebuffer and drives a real Chromium inside it, so it needs
# an X server plus the libraries the JBR and CEF link against. Everything else here is headless Gradle and
# npm, which is why the base image carries none of it.
#
# It is baked rather than installed per run because THE IMAGE IS THIS PIPELINE'S ONLY CACHING MECHANISM: a
# `dnf install` in a workflow step is a network transaction on every execution, and its failure mode is the
# job's worst one — a missing library does not announce itself, the IDE simply never opens its port.
#
# Its own layer, not appended to the JDK transaction above: the two answer to different consumers, and a
# change to either would otherwise invalidate the other's cache. Same manager, same flags and the same
# cache cleanup as that transaction — an image that installs two ways is an image nobody can reason about.
#
# `xorg-x11-server-Xvfb` is what supplies `xvfb-run`; `liberation-fonts` is what stops the IDE drawing
# boxes, which is not cosmetic here — text the harness reads has to be rendered before it can be read.

# THE WARM-UP, and the reason it is `testClasses` rather than `dependencies`.
#
# It used to be `./gradlew dependencies --configuration compileClasspath > /dev/null 2>&1 || true`, and that
# command does NOT warm this cache. It resolves dependency METADATA; it never triggers the artifact
# transform that EXTRACTS the IntelliJ Platform, which is where the several GB actually are. Measured: that
# command leaves caches/*/transforms at 179 MB with no extracted IDE in it. The image looked warm and every
# job re-downloaded and re-extracted the platform — invisibly, because of the redirect and the `|| true`.
#
# `testClasses` compiles main and test sources, so it resolves AND extracts everything the Gradle jobs need.
#
# No `> /dev/null`, and no `|| true`. A warm-up that fails must fail the image build: the whole point of
# this image is the cache, so "the cache step failed but the image is fine" is not a state worth being able
# to reach. Verified with the network disabled — `testClasses` compiles offline in 33s from this cache.

# are additive) — it prevents the confusion.
